# Financial Guidance Contradiction Tracker

> **"Bloomberg tracks keyword changes. This system detects reasoning-level contradictions and scores whether management can be trusted."**

A system that ingests Indian company earnings-call transcripts, extracts forward-guidance statements by CFOs/CEOs, detects hard and soft contradictions across quarters, and scores executive credibility by comparing predictions to actual outcomes — all surfaced in a Streamlit dashboard.

## System Architecture

```
DATA INGESTION → EXTRACTION → CONTRADICTION ENGINE → CREDIBILITY SCORER → DASHBOARD
```

| Layer | Module | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Data Ingestion | `ingestion/` | ✅ Week 1 |
| 2 — Extraction | `extraction/` | 🔜 Week 2 |
| 3 — Contradiction Engine | `contradiction/` | 🔜 Week 3–4 |
| 4 — Credibility Scorer | `credibility/` | 🔜 Week 5 |
| 5 — Dashboard | `dashboard/` | 🔜 Week 6 |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### 2. Initialise the database
```bash
python run_ingestion.py --init-only
```

### 3. Run full ingestion (5 companies, 8 quarters)
```bash
python run_ingestion.py
```

### 4. Single company (faster for testing)
```bash
# Infosys only, skip Screener.in
python run_ingestion.py --company 500209 --skip-screener
```

### 5. Force re-download
```bash
python run_ingestion.py --overwrite
```

## Build Milestones

| Week | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scraper working, 5 companies, 8 quarters of transcripts | ✅ |
| 2 | Speaker diarization + statement extractor + classifier | ✅ |
| 3 | FAISS index + NLI contradiction scorer | 🔜 |
| 4 | Soft contradiction detector + hedge escalation | 🔜 |
| 5 | Credibility scorer tracking 3 executives across 2 years | 🔜 |
| 6 | Streamlit dashboard: timeline + scorecard + search + PDF export | 🔜 |

---

## Database Schema

Five tables: `companies → executives → statements → contradictions → predictions`

SQLite for reads/writes · DuckDB for cross-quarter analytics queries.

---

## Recruiter Pitch

*"I built a system that tracks forward guidance contradictions in earnings calls — detecting both hard logical contradictions and soft sentiment reversals using NLI + hedge escalation scoring, then scoring executive credibility by comparing what was promised vs what was delivered across 8 quarters."*

## Running Instructions

Ensure your virtual environment is activated before running the scripts:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Week 1: Data Ingestion
This step downloads all earnings call PDFs from BSE India and financial metrics from Screener.in, then saves the raw text into the SQLite database.
```powershell
python run_ingestion.py
```
*(Tip: Use `python run_ingestion.py --help` for options like running a single company)*

### Week 2: Extraction Layer
This step processes the raw transcript text. It diarizes the text by speaker, extracts sentences, and uses FinBERT and regex rules to classify guidance types and sentiment.
```powershell
python run_extraction.py
```
*(Tip: Use `python run_extraction.py --limit 2` to test the pipeline on a subset of transcripts)*
